<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>
<h4>Selection sort:</h4>
Time Complexity = O(n2)

<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<li>Requires only a constant O(1) extra memory space.</li>
<li>It requires less number of swaps (or memory writes) compared to many other standard algorithms. It can be simple algorithm choice when memory writes are costly.</li>

<h3> Disadvantages:</h3>
<li>Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) makes it slower compared to algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.</li>
<li>Does not maintain the relative order of equal elements which means it is not stable.</li>

<h3>Applications:</h3>
<li>Suitable for small lists.</li>
<li>Heap Sort algorithm is based on Selection Sort.</li>

<h4>Bubble sort:</h4>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<li>It does not require any additional memory space.</li>
<li>It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.</li>

<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<li>Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n2) which makes it very slow for large data sets.</li>
<li>Bubble sort has almost no or limited real world applications.</li>
